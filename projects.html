                        Parallel Packed Memory Array to
                        Store Dynamic Graphs</a></h2>
                <ul class="text-left" style="display:inline-block;vertical-align:middle;">
                    <p>The ideal data structure for storing dynamic graphs would support fast updates as well as fast
                        range
                        queries which underlie graph traversals such as breadth-first search. The Packed Memory Array
                        (PMA)
                        seems like a good candidate for this setting because it supports fast updates as well as
                        cache-efficient range queries. Concurrently updating a PMA raises challenges, however, because
                        an
                        update may require rewriting the entire structure.
                        <br /><br />
                        This paper introduces a parallel PMA with intra- and inter-operation parallelism and
                        deadlock-free
                        polylogarithmicspan operations. Our main observation is that the PMA is well-suited to
                        concurrent
                        updates despite occasionally requiring a rewrite of the entire structure because 1) most of the
                        updates only write to a small part of the structure and 2) the worst case is highly parallel and
                        cache-efficient.
                        <br /><br />
                        To evaluate our data structure, we implemented Parallel Packed Compressed Sparse Row (PPCSR), a
                        dynamic-graph processing framework that extends the Ligra interface with graph updates. We show
                        that
                        PPCSR is on average about 1.6x faster on graph kernels than Aspen, a state-of-the-art
                        graph-streaming system. PPCSR achieves up to 80 million updates per second and is 2 – 5x faster
                        than
                        Aspen on most batch sizes. Finally, PPCSR is competitive with Ligra and Ligra+, two
                        state-of-the-art
                        static graph-processing frameworks.

                        Connectomics using Frugal Snap Judgments</a></h2>
                <ul class="text-left" style="display:inline-block;vertical-align:middle;">
                    <p>The accuracy and computational efficiency of image alignment directly affects
                        the advancement of connectomics, a field which seeks to understand the
                        structure of the brain through electron microscopy.
                        <br /><br />
                        We introduce the algorithms Quilter and Stacker that are designed to perform 2D
                        and 3D alignment respectively on petabyte-scale data sets from connectomics.
                        Quilter and Stacker are efficient, scalable, and simple to deploy on hardware
                        ranging from a researcher's laptop to a large computing cluster. On a single
                        18-core cloud machine each algorithm achieves throughputs of more than 1
                        TB/hr; when combined the algorithms produce an end-to-end alignment pipeline
                        that processes data at a rate of 0.82 TB/hr - an over 10x improvement
                        from previous systems. This efficiency comes from both traditional
                        optimizations and from the use of ``Frugal Snap Judgments'' to judiciously
                        exploit performance--accuracy trade offs.
                        <br /><br />
                        A high-throughput image-alignment pipeline was implemented using the Quilter
                        and Stacker algorithms and its performance was evaluated using three datasets
                        whose size ranged from 550GB to 38TB. The full alignment pipeline achieved
                        a throughput of 0.6-0.8 TB/hr and 1.4-1.5 TB/hr on an 18-core and
                        112-core shared-memory multicore, respectively. On a supercomputing cluster
                        with 200 nodes and 1600 total cores, the pipeline achieved a throughput of
                        21.4 TB/hr.

                <ul class="text-left" style="display:inline-block;vertical-align:middle;">
                    <p>Perhaps the most popular sparse graph storage format is Compressed Sparse Row (CSR). CSR excels
                        at
                        storing graphs compactly with minimal overhead, allowing for fast traversals, lookups, and basic
                        graph computations such as PageRank. Since elements in CSR format are packed together, additions
                        and
                        deletions often require time linear in the size of the graph.
                        <br /><br />
                        We introduce a new dynamic sparse
                        graph representation called Packed Compressed Sparse Row (PCSR), based on an array-based dynamic
                        data structure called the Packed Memory Array. PCSR is similar to CSR, but leaves spaces between
                        elements, allowing for asymptotically faster insertions and deletions in exchange for a constant
                        factor slowdown in traversals and a constant factor increase in space overhead.
                        <br /><br />
                        Our contributions
                        are twofold. We describe PCSR and review the theoretical guarantees for update, insert, and
                        search
                        for PCSR. We also implemented PCSR as well as other basic graph storage formats and report our
                        findings on a variety of benchmarks. PCSR supports inserts orders of magnitude faster than CSR
                        and
                        is only a factor of two slower on graph traversals. Our results suggest that PCSR is a
                        lightweight
                        dynamic graph representation that supports fast inserts and competitive searches.

                    <p>Energy efficiency is a key challenge for building modern sustainable societies. World’s energy
                        consumption is expected to grow annually by 1.6 %, increasing pressure for utilities and
                        governments
                        to fulfill demand and raising significant challenges in generation, distribution, and storage of
                        electricity. In this context, accurate predictions and understanding of population dynamics and
                        their relation to electricity demand dynamics is of high relevance.
                        <br /><br />
                        We introduce a simple machine learning (ML) method for day-ahead predictions of hourly energy
                        consumption, based on population and electricity demand dynamics. We use anonymized mobile phone
                        records (CDRs) and historical energy records from a small European country. CDRs are large-scale
                        data that is collected passively and on a regular basis by mobile phone carriers, including time
                        and
                        location of calls and text messages, as well as phones’ countries of origin. We show that simple
                        support vector machine (SVM) autoregressive models are capable of baseline energy demand
                        predictions
                        with accuracies below 3 % percentage error and active population predictions below 10 %
                        percentage
                        error. Moreover, we show that population dynamics from mobile phone records contain information
                        additional to that of electricity demand records, which can be exploited to improve prediction
                        performance. Finally, we illustrate how the joint analysis of population and electricity
                        dynamics
                        elicits insights into the relation between population and electricity demand segments, allowing
                        for
                        potential demand management interventions and policies beyond reactive supply-side operations.

                        The research explores the two issues above by producing (i) an easy-to-understand Black box
                        monitor
                        that avoids system failures by detecting possible breach of system’s correctness invariants,
                        ignoring the details of the autonomic controller, and (ii) a Decision Module that takes input
                        from
                        the monitor to predict decisions that could result in the system entering a high-risk state and
                        switching between the optimal RL-based autonomic controller and a sub-optimal safe controller.
